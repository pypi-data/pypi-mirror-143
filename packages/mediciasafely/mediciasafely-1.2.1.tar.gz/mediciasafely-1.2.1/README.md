# MediciaSAFELY Command Line Interface

This tool is part of the [MediciaSAFELY](https://www.medicia.ai) project. It is based on the open-source [OpenSAFELY](https://github.com/opensafely-core/opensafely-cli) project.

It gives a CLI to run local studies through the `mediciasafely` command.

To use it you will need to install:
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (at least version 3.8, but the more recent the better)
 * [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Once these are installed you can install the tool itself with:
```
pip install mediciasafely
```

To see available commands run
```
mediciasafely --help
```
