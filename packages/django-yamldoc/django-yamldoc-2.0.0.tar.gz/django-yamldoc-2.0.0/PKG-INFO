# `django-yamldoc`: Quoins for static sites

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-yamldoc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-yamldoc)

This is a Django application for maintaining documents in YAML format and
refining them to a traditional ORM’d database to serve them to users. It’s for
people who prefer VCS over SQL.

## Status

`yamldoc` is technically reusable, and used in multiple personal projects over
the years, with some individual YAML documents over a hundred thousand lines
long. However, `yamldoc` is probably of no interest to you. Its architecture
is less elegant than the average Django app, mixing various concerns united
only by the theme of refining YAML to HTML via quearyable SQL.

`yamldoc` is currently marked as compatible with `markdown < 3.3`. The two
packages are in fact still compatible at >= 3.3, but `markdown` performance
with large blocks of HTML was degraded in 3.3. This is relevant to `yamldoc`
and unsolved as of version 3.3.6, hence the soft block.

## History

`yamldoc` was originally called `vedm` for “Viktor Eikman’s Django miscellania”.

`yamlwrap`, available [here](https://github.com/veikman/yamlwrap), was once a
central component of `yamldoc`.
