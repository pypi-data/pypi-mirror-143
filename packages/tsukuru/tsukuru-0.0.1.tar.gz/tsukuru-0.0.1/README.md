# What's "tsukuru"?
"tsukuru" is simple GUI Makefile creator.  
"tsukuru" can provide simple way to create Makefile from GUI.   
"Tsukuru" means "Make" in Japanense.  

Nowadays, many IDEs provides smart way to build systems.  
But in C/C++ language, we sometimes have to make Makefile or CMkaeLists.txt.  
These tools has long history and wonderful functions,  
and helps building from one source code to very very large projects.  

"tsukuru" aim is to private simple way to build C/C++ in provate project or small teams.  
In this situation,  If no skillfull Makefile user, someone needs to learn about Makefile.  
And in a few month, his/her knowledge about Makefile goes away...  

I would like to contribute these situation by providing simple GUI Makefile creator.  
This tools does not support deep and wide function, 
but provide creating certain Makefile.
