# ychaos

YChaos is a self-serving chaos testing toolkit designed to
provide users with all the capabilities of doing an end to end resilience
testing of your service. YChaos is designed to give users a framework
to validate, verify and attack your system to simulate real life
failures that might cause outages in your service.

To get started with YChaos, refer to the [documentation](https://yahoo.github.io/ychaos)

## Background

The most important aspect of maintaining a web service on cloud
infrastructure is to make it resilient from failures. Most of
these failures are unexpected and are not tested while development.
The service which is capable of handling an unexpected failure passes the
criteria of a resilient service.

YChaos provides a self-serving framework to inject these unexpected failures
into your service in the form of YChaos Agents and understand if your service
is equipped to handle unknown failures either within the service
or from a 3rd party service dependency.

## Install

To install ychaos from PyPi,

```bash
pip install ychaos[<subpackage>]
```
