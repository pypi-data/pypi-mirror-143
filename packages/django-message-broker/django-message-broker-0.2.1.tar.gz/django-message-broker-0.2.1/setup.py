It interfaces with Django Channels and Celery [1], and replaces the need\nfor separate message brokers such as Redis and RabbitMQ.\n\nThe motivating use case for Django Message Broker is small site solutions where it is\neasier to deploy a single server containing all the required functionality rather than a\nmulti-server solution. An example would be a small site running data science models, where\nexecuting the model is a long running process and needs to execute in the background so\nthat it doesnâ€™t degrade the responsiveness of the user interface.\n\nPotential scenarios for Django Message Broker include:\n\n+ Prototyping, Testing, Training\n+ Data science projects where the model complexity exceeds the capabilities of packages such\n  as Shiny, Dash and Streamlit.\n+ Small systems with a low number of users.\n\nThe Django Message Broker is an installable component of the Django platform that provides\nan easy to install, all-in-one alternative for small scale solutions. It does not replace\nthe need for high volume message brokers where message volume and redundancy are important.\n\n**Note**\n\n1. The Celery interface is in development and not supported in this release. \n\n## Installation\n\nInstall latest stable version into your python environment using pip::\n\n    pip install django-message-broker\n\nOnce installed add ``django_message_broker`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in settings.py:\n\n    INSTALLED_APPS = (\n        \'django_message_broker\',\n        ...        \n    )\n\nDjango Message Broker should be installed as early as possible in the installed applications\nlist and ideally before other applications such as Channels and Celery. The message broker\nforks a background process which should occur before other applications create new threads in\nthe current process.\n\n## Configure Django Channels Layers\n\nTo configure the Django Message Broker as a Channels layer add the following to the ``CHANNEL_LAYERS``\nsetting in settings.py:\n\n    CHANNEL_LAYERS = {\n        \'default\': {\n            \'BACKEND\': \'django_message_broker.ChannelsServerLayer\',\n        },\n    }\n',
