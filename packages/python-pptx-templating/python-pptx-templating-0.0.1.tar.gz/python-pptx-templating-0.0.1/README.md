## Name
python-pptx-templating

## Description
The goal of this library is to add templating feature to python-pptx.
By templating I mean a possibility to create new slides & slide decks based on pre-populated master slides.
It requires a certain way to name placeholders and placeholder content using mustache templating.

## Installation
TODO Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
TODO Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
