        =====================
        Redturtle RSS Service
        =====================
        
        This package add support to retrieve RSS feeds from external sources.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        RSS proxy
        ---------
        
        There is a service "**@get_rss_feed**" that is used as proxy to call an
        RSS feed from backend and not from frontend to avoid CORS problems.
        
        The service will reply with an "application/rss+xml" response with the desired feed.
        
        Each feed url has a 10 minutes cache for his result to avoid too much requests.
        
        You can call the endpoint passing a *feed* parameter like this example::
        
            > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@get_rss_feed?feed=https://www.plone.org/RSS -H 'Accept: application/rss+xml'
        
        
        RSS block
        ---------
        
        There is a service "**@rss_mixer_data**" that accept a list of sources and limit, and return a list of sorted feeds by date.
        
        This service only accept POST calls and accept following parameters:
        
        - limit: the number of items to show (default 20)
        - feeds: a list of objects like this: {"url": "url-of-the-feed", "source": "A custom label"}
        
        For example::
        
            > curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/Plone/@rss_mixer_data -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"limit":5, "feeds": [{"url": "url-of-the-feed", "source": "A custom label"}]}'
        
        
        Will reply with something like this::
        
            [
                {
                    "source": "Foo site",
                    "contentSnippet": "some description 2",
                    "title": "Foo News 2",
                    "date": "Thu, 1 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
                    "url": "http://test.com/foo-news-2"
                },
                {
                    "source": "",
                    "contentSnippet": "some description 2",
                    "title": "Bar News 2",
                    "date": "Thu, 1 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
                    "url": "http://test.com/bar-news-2"
                },
                {
                    "source": "Foo site",
                    "contentSnippet": "some description",
                    "title": "Foo News 1",
                    "date": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
                    "url": "http://test.com/foo-news-1"
                },
                {
                    "source": "",
                    "contentSnippet": "some description",
                    "title": "Bar News 1",
                    "date": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
                    "url": "http://test.com/bar-news-1"
                }
            ]
