=====================
Redturtle RSS Service
=====================

This package add support to retrieve RSS feeds from external sources.

Usage
=====

RSS proxy
---------

There is a service "**@get_rss_feed**" that is used as proxy to call an
RSS feed from backend and not from frontend to avoid CORS problems.

The service will reply with an "application/rss+xml" response with the desired feed.

Each feed url has a 10 minutes cache for his result to avoid too much requests.

You can call the endpoint passing a *feed* parameter like this example::

    > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@get_rss_feed?feed=https://www.plone.org/RSS -H 'Accept: application/rss+xml'


RSS block
---------

There is a service "**@rss_mixer_data**" that accept a list of sources and limit, and return a list of sorted feeds by date.

This service only accept POST calls and accept following parameters:

- limit: the number of items to show (default 20)
- feeds: a list of objects like this: {"url": "url-of-the-feed", "source": "A custom label"}

For example::

    > curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/Plone/@rss_mixer_data -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"limit":5, "feeds": [{"url": "url-of-the-feed", "source": "A custom label"}]}'


Will reply with something like this::

    [
        {
            "source": "Foo site",
            "contentSnippet": "some description 2",
            "title": "Foo News 2",
            "date": "Thu, 1 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/foo-news-2"
        },
        {
            "source": "",
            "contentSnippet": "some description 2",
            "title": "Bar News 2",
            "date": "Thu, 1 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/bar-news-2"
        },
        {
            "source": "Foo site",
            "contentSnippet": "some description",
            "title": "Foo News 1",
            "date": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/foo-news-1"
        },
        {
            "source": "",
            "contentSnippet": "some description",
            "title": "Bar News 1",
            "date": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 10:44:01 +0200",
            "url": "http://test.com/bar-news-1"
        }
    ]
