tealc string
===============
Estimate tension for a single string.

    REQUIRED (positional):
        gauge
            String gauge in inches, 1/1000in, or mm with the --si flag. Inch gauges may optionally be in thousandths: "11" or ".011" are both valid and produce the same output.

        material
            Short code for string construction material. Options:
               code  material
               ----  --------
                 ps  plain steel
                nps  nickel plated steel wound
                 pb  phosphor bronze wound
               8020  80/20 bronze wound
               8515  85/15 bronze wound
                 ss  stainless steel roundwound
                 fw  stainless steel flatwound
                 pn  pure nickel wound
               bnps  bass: nickel plated steel roundwound
                bss  bass: stainless steel roundwound
                bfw  bass: stainless steel flatwound

        pitch
            Tuned pitch of string in scientific pitch notation, from A0-E5. Middle C is C4, and A440 is A4. 
            Examples of open-string pitches in standard tunings:
                Guitar: E2, A2, D3, G3, B3, E4
                Bass: (B0), E1, A1, D2, G2
                Mandolin/violin: G3, D4, A4, E5
                Banjo: G4, D3, G3, B3, D4

        length
            Scale length of the instrument in inches, 1/1000in, or mm with the --si flag.

    OPTIONAL:
        --si
            Supply <gauge> and <length> arguments in millimenters. Tension is returned in kilograms. (Yes, pedants, Newtons are the proper SI units for forces.)

    EXAMPLES:
        tealc string .011 ps E4 25.5
        tealc string --si 1.37 pb E2 632.5

tealc set
============
Estimate individual and total tensions for a string set. String sets may either be entered on the command line or read from a "set file".

Set files use the following format:
    ---- begin set file ---
    [set]
    length = LENGTH
    gauges = G [G ...]
    materials = M [M ...]
    pitches = P [str ...]
    si = true OR false (optional)
    ---- end set file ----

The [set] section header and all keys are required. Any other sections or keys are ignored. Lists for gauges, materials, and pitches keys must be of equal length. List items are space-separated. An example set file for a set of medium-gauge electric guitar strings on a Fender-scale instrument, with nickel plated steel wound strings, might look like this:

    ---- begin set file ----
    [set]
    length = 25.5
    gauges = 11 15 18 26 36 50
    materials = ps ps ps nps nps nps
    pitches = e4 b3 d3 g3 a2 e2
    ---- end set file ----

When entering sets on the command line, --gauges, --materials, and --pitches must have the same number of arguments.

    ARGUMENTS:
        --file FILE
            A path to a valid set file. Any arguments other than --title are ignored if --file is present.
        
        --length LENGTH
            Scale length of instrument in inches, 1/1000in, or mm with the --si flag.

        --gauges [G ...]
            List of string gauges in inches, 1/1000in, or mm with the --si flag.
        
        --materials [M ...]
            List of valid string material codes.
            Options: ps, nps, pb, 8020, 8515, ss, fw, pn, bnps, bss, bfw.

        --pitches [P ...]
            List of pitches in scientific pitch notation, from A0-E5. Middle C is C4, and A440 is A4.

        --si
            Supply --length and --gauges arguments in millimeters. String and set total tensions are returned in kilograms.

        --title TITLE
            Optional title for output chart.

        EXAMPLES:
            tealc set ~/path/to/set.txt

            tealc set --length 25.5 --gauges 11 15 18 26 36 50 --materials ps ps ps nps nps nps --pitches e4 b3 g3 d3 a2 e2
