tealc string
===============
Calucate tension estimate for a single string.

    REQUIRED:
        GAUGE
            String gauge in inches, 1/1000in, or mm with the --si flag. Inch
            gauges may optionally be in thousandths: "11" or ".011" are both
            valid and produce the same output.

        MATERIAL
            Short code for string construction material. Options:
               code  material
               ----  --------
                 ps  plain steel
                nps  nickel plated steel wound
                 pb  phosphor bronze wound
               8020  80/20 bronze wound
               8515  85/15 bronze wound
                 ss  stainless steel roundwound
                 fw  stainless steel flatwound
                 pn  pure nickel wound
               bnps  bass: nickel plated steel roundwound
                bss  bass: stainless steel roundwound
                bfw  bass: stainless steel flatwound

        PITCH
            Tuned pitch of string in scientific pitch notation, from A0-E5.
            Middle C is C4, and A440 is A4. Octaves change at C: A2, B2 is
            followed by C3, D3, ..., A3, B3, C4, ...
            Examples of open-string pitches in standard tunings:
                Guitar: E2, A2, D3, G3, B3, E4
                Bass: (B0), E1, A1, D2, G2
                Mandolin/violin: G3, D4, A4, E5
                Banjo: G4, D3, G3, B3, D4

        LENGTH
            Scale length of the instrument in inches, 1/1000in, or mm with the
            --si flag.

    OPTIONAL:
        --si
            Supply GAUGE and LENGTH arguments in millimenters inctead of inches.
            Tension is returned in kilograms. (Yes, pedants, Newtons are the
            proper SI units for forces.)

    EXAMPLES:
        tealc string .011 ps E4 25.5
        tealc string --si 1.37 pb E2 632.5

tealc set
===============
Calculate tension estimates for a string set.

    REQUIRED:
        -l, --length LENGTH
            Scale length, just as in "tealc string"

        -s, --string <GAUGE MATERIAL PITCH>...
            Repeated option, per string for the entire set. Requiremnts for
            the sub-arguments in <GAUGE MATERIAL PITCH> are just as in
            "tealc string".

    OPTIONAL:
        --si
            Supply set-wide --length and per-string GAUGE arguments in
            millimenters inctead of inches. Tension is returned in kilograms.

        --title TEXT
            An optional title for the output chart.

    EXAMPLES:
        tealc set -l 25.5 -s 10 ps e4 13 -s 13 ps b3 -s 17 ps g3 -s 26 nps d3 \
            -s 36 nps a3 46 -s 46 nps e2

        tealc set -l 34 -s 45 bfw g2 -s 60 bfw d2 -s 80 bfw a1 -s 105 bfw e1 \
            --title "Bass Flatwound Mediums"

tealc file
===============
Calculate string set tension estimates from a file.

    REQUIRED:
        SETFILE
            A file formatted using the format:

            length = LENGTH
            GAUGE MATERIAL PITCH
            [GAUGE MATERIAL PITCH]
            [...]
            [si = True or False]

            An example SETFILE for a common set of light gauge ("10's") electric
            guitar strings on a Fender-scale instrument, with nickel plated
            steel wound strings, would look like this:

            length = 25.5
            10 ps e4
            13 ps b3
            17 ps g3
            26 nps d3
            36 nps a2
            46 nps e2

            The "length = ..." line and at least one "GAUGE MATERIAL PITCH" line
            are required.

            "si = False" is not required, and the SetFileParser.si attribute
            defaults to False if no "si = ..." line is included.

    OPTIONAL:
        --si
            Show output chart units in mm/kg.
        
        --title TEXT
            An optional title for the output chart.

    EXAMPLE:
        tealc file ~/path/to/setfile
