# Visualize3D

> A small library to help with 3d visualizing (pointclouds).

## Getting Started

Please make sure you have pytorch installed properly as a first step.

```bash
pip install visualize3d
```

## Usage

In your code you can create visualizations:
```python
import numpy as np
import visualize3d as v3d

# First create a list of geometries to show.
N=42
geometries = [
    # Pointcloud (N, 3)
    v3d.create_pointcloud_from_numpy(
        pointcloud=np.random.rand(N, 3),
    ),
    # Add random lines (e.g. for a box or trajectory)
    v3d.create_lines_from_numpy(
        points=np.random.rand(N, 3),
        lines=np.array([i, i + 1] for i in range(N - 1)),
    ),
    # Add the origin arrows (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue).
    v3d.create_origin()
]

# Save visualization to disk (usefull in remote work or when batch processing)
v3d.save("output.v3d.npy", geometries)

# or show directly (if you work locally or interactive)
v3d.show(geometries)
```

To show a visualization that was saved to disk, you can write your own code or simply use the `visualize3d` commandline tool.
```bash
# Show visualization from above
visualize3d /path/to/output.v3d.npy

# Show a pcd file directly
visualize3d /path/to/filename.pcd

# Show all supported files in a folder after another
visualize3d /path/to/folder
```
