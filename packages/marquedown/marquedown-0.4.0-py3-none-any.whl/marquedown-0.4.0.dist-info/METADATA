# Marquedown

Extending Markdown further by adding a few more useful notations.
It can be used in place of `markdown` as it also uses and applies it.

## Examples

### Blockquote with citation

This is currently limited to the top scope with no indentation.
Surrounding dotted lines are optional.

```md

> You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up
> for something, sometime in your life.
-- Winston Churchill
