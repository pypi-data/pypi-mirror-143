For single-instance and multi-instance object detection, this
directory contains the following script:

    single_instance_detection.py

    multi_instance_object_detection.py

The first of these requires the following dataset:

    PurdueDrEvalDataset

and the second requires the dataset:

    PurdueDrEvalMultiDataset

The main webpage for the RegionProposalGenerator module contains
information on how to download and install the datasets.


===============================================================


For graph-based algorithms for generating region proposals:

The following three sub-directories contain the results obtained 
using the RPG module:

   mondrian

   color_blobs

   wallpic2

All you have to do is to execute

   selective_search.py

that is already included in the respective directories.

Make sure that you set the constructor parameter

   image_size_reduction_factor

so that the number of nodes in the initial graph does not
exceed around 3500 in order to get the results back in a
reasonable length of time.
