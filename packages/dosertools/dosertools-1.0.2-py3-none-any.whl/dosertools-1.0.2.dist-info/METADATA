# dosertools

dosertools is a Python package for analyzing dripping-onto-substrate extensional rheology (DoSER) videos.\
The software converts an input video into a series of binary images, produces a dataset of D/D0 and time values for 
each frame in the video, and generates values for the elongational relaxation time lambda_E, the diameter at critical 
time (the onset of elasto-capillary behavior) D(t_c)/D0, and a guess for the quantity of 
(elongational viscosity / surface tension) eta_E/sigma.

## Installation

dosertools comes bundled with a pipfile which creates the python environment it needs to run. 
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pipenv. 
You will need to install
pipenv if your installation of python doesn't have it. You can do this by typing 
```bash
pip install pipenv
````
in your terminal, followed by 
```bash
pipenv install
```
 in the terminal from your dosertools directory. 

See the file named "example-and-settings.md" and "example_script.py" for more information 
on how to use this package.
## Usage
dosertools is expecting experiments that contain a pair of videos - one "experimental" video that contains 
the fluid transitioning from needle to substrate, and one "background" video that contains only the
needle and the literal background of the camera's view. In our testing, we found a background video 
of 100 frames gives plenty of data to overcome any noise that would be found in a single frame. 

dosertools is written for DoSER videos of viscoelastic fluids. It can perform background 
subtraction and image processing on videos of any type. However, the data processing 
(calculating elongational relaxation time, elongational viscosity, etc) is done using assumptions that
are only true for fluids that exhibit elastocapillary behavior. 

dosertools calculates values with machine precision. It is up to the user to decide where to truncate the 
data produced, based on the specifics of their own experimental setup.

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
