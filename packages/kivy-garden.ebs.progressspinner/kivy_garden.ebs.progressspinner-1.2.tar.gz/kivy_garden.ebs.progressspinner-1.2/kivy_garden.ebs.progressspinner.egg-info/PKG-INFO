        About this Fork
        ---------------
        
        This package builds on a lot of good work of other people, including :
          - The original [kivy.garden.progressspinner](https://github.com/kivy-garden/garden.progressspinner), 
          written by @kived and contributed to over the years by others.  
          - Fork by [@stimpe](https://github.com/stimpe/garden.progressspinner), making the package pip installable.
          - At the time of the fork, upstream has remained unchanged 
          for 8 years. 
          - The fork has remained unchanged for 2 years. 
        
        This is forked from `stimpe/garden.progressspinner` for the sole purpose of 
        making it pip installable from PyPI. and will be made available as the 
        `kivy_garden.ebs.progressspinner` package on PyPI. 
        
        This package has no dependencies in the ebs namespace - it is simply used as 
        a convenient way to differentiate from the upstream package and restrict 
        namespace pollution to within the existing ebs namespace.
        
        If you are considering using this: 
        
          - The original package works just fine, and has been working unmodified for 
          almost a decade at the time of this fork. No development is required or 
          planned. If you're fine with 'garden install progressspinner', don't use this
          fork.
          - If upstream makes itself pip installable, this fork and the associated PyPI 
          package will likely become unmaintained.
          - Some minor work may be needed to done to bring this in line with the new 
          `kivy_garden` format. I'm not actively working on this, but if the need for 
          it arises in form or another, I might look into it. Create an issue if you 
          have a use case which calls for it.
          
        If you do end up using this package - especially if you do so in a 
        production setting - please reach out to me and let me know by email at 
        shashank at chintal dot in. The number of users, if any, is likely to 
        determine how much effort I will put into maintaining this.
