        ## Installing Software
        
        ### One-line Installer
        
        We've created a super-easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your HAT up and running in a jiffy. To run it fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop like so:
        
        ![Finding the terminal](terminal.jpg)
        
        In the new terminal window type the following and follow the instructions:
        
        ```
        curl -sS get.pimoroni.com/skywriter | bash
        ```
        
        ### From PyPi (Stable)
        
        Install `smbus`:
        
        ```
        sudo apt install python3-smbus
        ```
        
        Enable i2c:
        
        ```
        sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
        ```
        
        Install the library:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install skywriter
        ```
        
        ### From Source (Unstable/Latest)
        
        Install `smbus`:
        
        ```
        sudo apt install python3-smbus
        ```
        
        Enable i2c:
        
        ```
        sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
        ```
        
        Install the library:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/skywriter-hat
        cd skywriter-hat/python/library
        python3 setup.py install
        ```

        ## Skywriter to Pi Connection
        
        You can use a full-sized Skywriter board with your Raspberry Pi and our library by mimicking the connections that the HAT users. They are as follows:
        
        Skywriter  | Raspberry Pi
        -----------|--------------
        GND        | GND
        TRFR       | GPIO 27
        RESET      | GPIO 17
        SCL        | GPIO 3 / SCL
        SDA        | GPIO 2 / SDA
        VCC        | 3V
