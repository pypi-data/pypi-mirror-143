# vt-timetable

A python module for scraping the Virginia Tech Timetable of Classes.

This module makes it easy to get data from the Virginia Tech Timetable of
Classes using python. The most important components of the module are the
`search_timetable` function, which directly searches the timetable with the
provided parameters, and the `Course` class, which contains data about a
course. Additionally, `get_crn` makes it easier to search for a specific
course. The two other functions, `get_semesters` and `get_subjects`, make it
possible to check which search parameters are valid.
