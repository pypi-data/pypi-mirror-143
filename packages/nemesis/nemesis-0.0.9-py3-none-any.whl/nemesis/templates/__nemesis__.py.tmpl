# # Now that Nemesis has been created, lets import some resources and make something
#
# from nemesis.resources.elasticsearch.ingest_pipeline import IngestPipeline
#
# ip = IngestPipeline(
#    id="some-id",
#    description="a nicely written description",
#    processors = [< a list of processors>],
#  )
#
# n.register(ip)
#
# # Now you can save this file and run `nemesis preview` to see what will be deployed.
# # And then run `nemesis launch` to actually deploy the resource into Elasticsearch.
