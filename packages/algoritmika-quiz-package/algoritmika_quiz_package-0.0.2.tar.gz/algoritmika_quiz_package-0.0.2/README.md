# Math quiz package

### My unique package with unique functionality, which wasn't on https://pypi.org/

In variable `OPERATIONS_DICT` store user and math operations. 

`random_calculator` function generating random numbers for user, and choice random math operation from 
`OPERATIONS_FOR_USER` list, where stored `OPERATIONS_DICT` keys with user operations - `+  - * /`.

After generating numbers and choosing math operation calculated result, and ask user for his
answer in function `user_poll`. 

Using `quiz` func to poll user required number of times and for count his correct answers
