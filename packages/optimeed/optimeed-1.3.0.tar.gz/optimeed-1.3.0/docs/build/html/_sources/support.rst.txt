License and Support
===================

License
-------

The project is distributed "has it is" under `GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.fr.html>`_, which is a strong copyleft license.
This means that the code is open-source and you are free to do anything you want with it, **as long as you apply the same license to distribute your code**.
This constraining license is imposed by the use of `Platypus Library <https://platypus.readthedocs.io/en/docs/index.html>`_ as "optimization algorithm library", which is under GPL license.

It is perfectly possible to use other optimization library (which would use the same algorithms but with a different implementation) and to interface it to this project, so that the use of platypus is no longer needed. This work has already been done for `NLopt <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which is under MIT license (not constraining at all).
In that case, **after removing all the platypus sources** (optiAlgorithms/multiObjective_GA and optiAlgorithsm/platypus/*), the license of the present work becomes less restrictive: `GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`_. As for the GPL, this license makes the project open-source and free to be modified, but (nearly) no limitation is made to distribute your code.
