Finesse 3.0 LIGO models, tools, and data.

## Installation
TBA

## Usage and Contributing
This package includes top-level tools and models for simulating LIGO in Finesse 3. Individal simulations that you perform should be stored elsewhere, such as the `finesse_playground` reposistory. Your scripts can just depend and import this package, or if you want to make more internal changes you can fork the project.

## Support
Please post an issue if you are experiencing any bugs, problems, or feature requests. `https://chat.ligo.org/ligo/channels/finesse` can also be used for broader discussion on Finesse and modelling LIGO with it.
