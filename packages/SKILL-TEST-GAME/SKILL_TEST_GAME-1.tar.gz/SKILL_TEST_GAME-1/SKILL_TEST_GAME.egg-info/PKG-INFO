Description: # SKILL_TEST_GAME
        
        Welcome to <b>Skill Test Game</b>. In this game, you will take skill tests to earn skill badges like when taking 
        LinkedIn Skill Assessments (https://www.linkedin.com/skill-assessments/hub/quizzes/).
        
        # Executable File
        
        The executable file is downloadable at 
        https://github.com/DigitalCreativeApkDev/SKILL_TEST_GAME/blob/master/SKILL_TEST_GAME/dist/skill_test_game/skill_test_game.
        
        # Source Code
        
        Python code used to create the game is available in 
        https://github.com/DigitalCreativeApkDev/SKILL_TEST_GAME/blob/master/SKILL_TEST_GAME/skill_test_game.py.
        
        # Installation
        
        pip install SKILL_TEST_GAME
        
        # How to Use the Executable File?
        
        First, open by double-clicking the file "skill_test_game". 
        How the executable file looks like is shown in the image below (the file is enclosed with a red rectangle).

        # Getting Started
        
        After you run the game, you will be asked to enter your name. If the saved game data with your name is available, it 
        will be loaded. Else, a new game data will be created.

        # Main Menu
        
        After you either created new game data or load saved game data, you will be asked whether you want to continue playing 
        the game "Skill Test Game" or not. If you enter 'Y', a list of skill tests you can take will be shown if there are 
        skill tests you can take. You will be able to take skill tests where you have not earned a badge and have attempted 
        less than twice in six months.

        # The Game
        
        In the game, Python skill test is available. To earn a skill badge for this skill test, you will need to earn a score 
        of at least 80% for the skill test. You need to choose the correct answer and then press 'RETURN' key on Mac or 
        'ENTER' key on Windows in 90 seconds or less for a question to earn a point for that question. Failing to answer the 
        question in 90 seconds will make the game advance to the next question and your answer to that question will be 
        considered incorrect.
        
        The screenshot below shows how a question in the Python skill test looks like.

        After answering all questions in a skill test, your score will appear on the screen. If you score 80% or above for 
        the skill test you take, you will be asked whether you want to add your skill badge to your LinkedIn profile or not. If 
        you enter 'Y', the details of information to be added to your LinkedIn profile will be shown. Else, you will be 
        redirected to the 'Main Menu' of the game.
