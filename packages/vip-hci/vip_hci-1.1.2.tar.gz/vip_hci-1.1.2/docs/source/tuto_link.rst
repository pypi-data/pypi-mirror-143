Running the tutorials
---------------------

Tutorials, in the form of Jupyter notebooks, showcasing ``VIP``'s usage and 
other resources can be visualised within this documentation.
In order to execute them, you can either download/clone the 
``VIP-extras`` `repository <https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP_extras>`_, and open each tutorial locally with jupyter notebook. 
Alternatively, you can execute these tutorials on 
`Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/vortex-exoplanet/VIP_extras/master>`_. 

If you are new to the Jupyter notebook application check out the `beginner's guide
