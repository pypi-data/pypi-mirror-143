    """
    The `InverseKinematics` maps car speeds at the chassis level to wheel commands that the robot
    can execute.

    `InverseKinematics` utilises the car geometry as well as a number of parameters to calculate
    the wheel commands that the wheels should execute in order for the robot to perform the
    desired chassis commands.

    Args:
        wheel_baseline (:obj:`float`):  the distance between the two wheels of the robot
        wheel_radius (:obj:`float`):    radius of the wheel

        gain (:obj:`float`):            scaling factor applied to the desired velocity
        trim (:obj:`float`):            trimming factor used to offset differences in the
                                        behaviour of the left and right motors, it is recommended

                                        straight line when equal forward commands are given
        k (:obj:`float`):               motor constant, assumed equal for both motors
        limit (:obj:`float`):           limits the final commands sent to the motors
        v_max (:obj:`float`):           limits the input velocity
        omega_max (:obj:`float`):       limits the input steering angle
