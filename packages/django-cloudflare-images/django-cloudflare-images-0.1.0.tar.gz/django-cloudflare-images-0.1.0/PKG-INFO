# django-cloudflare-images

This is a Django library to add support to Cloudflare Images to the ImageField.

## Installation

You need to add the following your settings.py:

```python
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "cloudflare_images.storage.CloudflareImagesStorage"

CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_ACCOUNT_HASH = "ZZZ"
```

## TODO

This is a list of non exhaustive list of things I would like to add to the project:

 * Ability to pass down variants instead of hardcoding "public"
 * Support custom domains (optional)
 * Functional tests with real credentials (to be passed in the environment)
