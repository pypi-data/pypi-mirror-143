## What is a Facial Device? ##

A facial device is a device that provides special care similar to that of a beauty salon in the comfort of your own home. They use heat, cold, vibration, electric current, and light to approach the skin and muscles to make the skin healthier and more beautiful.

By adding this device to your regular skin care regimen, you can expect to see positive effects for skin problems such as dryness, blackheads in pores, sagging of the face line, blemishes, and wrinkles.

## Different types of facial devices ##

The following are the main types of facial devices.

**RF (radio frequency)**: [RF (radio frequency) skin device](https://www.llskin.jp/products/via/), a type of electromagnetic wave, is irradiated to the skin to react with moisture inside the skin (down to the stratum corneum) to raise skin temperature and activate metabolism. It regulates skin turnover, facial flabbiness, etc.

**Water-peeling**: Ultrasonic vibrations create a mist of water that removes dirt and dead skin cells from pores. Recommended for those who are concerned about dirty and rough skin.

**Steamer**: Emits warm steam (vapor) or cold steam to softly envelop the entire face and condition the skin, making it easier for lotions and serums to penetrate to the horny layer. Recommended for dry skin.

**Ionizing/Ionizing**: Ionizing/Ionizing/Ionizing type: Ionizing/Ionizing/Ionizing type applies a weak electric current to the skin to make it easier for beauty ingredients in lotions and serums to penetrate to the stratum corneum (introduction) and to remove dirt from the skin surface by adsorbing it (extraction).

**EMS**: EMS stands for Electrical Muscle Stimulation. It applies a weak electric current to the muscles and approaches the facial muscles that cause loose skin around the cheeks and mouth. It is expected to lift face lines and tighten the skin.

**Roller**: Rolling over the skin helps to improve blood circulation. Recommended for swelling, sagging, wrinkles, and lines.

**Light (LED)**: [LED therapy](https://www.llskin.jp/products/yoko/) (Light Emitting Diode) light is irradiated onto the skin. Depending on the color of the light, it is possible to tailor the treatment to various skin types and concerns.

- Blue: for acne care. Continued use of this product will reduce the risk of acne formation.

- Red: For aging skin, dry skin, and other age-appropriate anti-aging skin care.
