# gtirb-test-helpers

Provides helper functions to make creating GTIRB IR in tests easier and more
concise.

## Code generation

The gtirb-generate-python-code package can generate gtirb-test-helpers code
from a chunk of assembly code. This can serve as a good starting point to
generating the specific GTIRB that a test needs.
