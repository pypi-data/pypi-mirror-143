A simple tools to get the entries of a java projects, based on [javalang](https://github.com/c2nes/javalang) library.

## Installation

You can simply install it with `pip` command line from the official PyPI site.

```
pip install jentry
```

For more information about installation, you can refer to the [installation guide](https://hansbug.github.io/jentry/main/tutorials/installation/index.html).

## Quick Start

### Use with CLI

You can directly use `jentry` CLI to get the entry of a java project. Such as the command below

```bash
jentry demo
```

The output should be like as shown follow (in this project, we have 2 different entries)

```
Main
homework.Main
```



### Only Use One Entry

You can get exactly one entry with `-F` command

```bash
jentry -F demo
```

The output should be

```
Main
```

This command can be used when you are trying to run a compiled java project, like this

```bash
java -cp target:${CLASSPATH} $(jentry -F demo)
```

The entry it found will be applied into the `java` command line.



### Pretty Print Entry

Actually, these entries can be printed with prettier ways, such as json and table.

```bash
jentry -f json demo
```

The json-formatted output.

```json
[
    {
        "entrance": "Main",
        "package": null,
        "class": "Main",
        "file": "demo/2018_spring_16061104_10/src/Main.java"
    },
    {
        "entrance": "homework.Main",
        "package": "homework",
        "class": "Main",
        "file": "demo/oo_course_2019_17373331_homework_2/src/homework/Main.java"
    }
]
```

And if the `-f` option is assigned to `table`

```bash
jentry -f table demo
```

A table with all the entries will be placed together.

```
+---------------+----------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|     Entry     | Package  | Class |                            Filename                            |
+---------------+----------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Main     |  <none>  |  Main |           demo/2018_spring_16061104_10/src/Main.java           |
| homework.Main | homework |  Main | demo/oo_course_2019_17373331_homework_2/src/homework/Main.java |
+---------------+----------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Other features can be found in the help information, which can be displayed with `-h` option.

```

```
<JavaEntry class: Main, filename: 'demo/2018_spring_16061104_10/src/Main.java'>
