CLIVE
=====

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/clive)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CLIve)

When following a Reddit live feed, who wants to have a big ugly webpage open
all the time? Not me, and perhaps not you either.

So I started to write a command line interface that prints messages
as they arrive. It's still a **little** rough as I put this together in a few
hours, so consider it a work in progress. Contributions and suggestions
welcome and encouraged.

If you are wondering why *clive*, it's a  blend of *cli* and *live*.


Installation
------------

    $ pip install clive

Usage
-----

    $ clive wmk50bsm9vt3

Where `wmk50bsm9vt3` is the last part of the live feed URL from Reddit.
