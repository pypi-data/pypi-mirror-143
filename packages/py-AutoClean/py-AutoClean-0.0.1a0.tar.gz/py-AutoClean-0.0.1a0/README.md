```

:thought_balloon: Read more on how the algorithm of AutoClean works in my Medium article [Automated Data Cleaning withÂ Python](link).

## Description
It is commonly known among Data Scientists that data cleaning and preprocessing make up a major part of a data science project. And, in all honesty, on average it is not the most exciting part of the project.

:white_check_mark: AutoClean helps you **save time** in major parts of these tasks and performs **preprocessing** in an **automated manner**!

AutoClean supports:

:point_right: Various imputation methods for **missing values**  
:point_right: Handling of **outliers**  
:point_right: **Encoding** of categorical data (OneHot, Label)  
:point_right: **Extraction** of datatime values  
:point_right: and more!

As an example, the following sample dataset will be passed through the AutoClean pipeline:
