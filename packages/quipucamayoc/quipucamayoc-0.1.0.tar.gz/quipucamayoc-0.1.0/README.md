[quipucamayoc](http://scorreia.com/software/quipucamayoc/) is a Python package that simplifies the extraction of historical data from scanned images and PDFs.
It's designed to be modular and so it can be used together with other existing tools, and can be extended easily by users.

For an overview of how to use  `quipucamayoc` to digitize historical data, see [this research article](http://scorreia.com/research/digitizing.pdf), which amongst other things details the different steps involved, the methods used, and provides practical examples.
For an user guide, documentation, and installation instructions, see <http://scorreia.com/software/quipucamayoc/> (TODO).

If you want to contribute by improving the code or extending its functionality (much welcome!), head [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Installation

### Pip

To manage quipucamayoc using pip, open the command line and run:

- `pip install quipucamayoc` to install
    - `pip install "quipucamayoc[dev]"` to include extra dependencies used when developing the code
- `pip install -U quipucamayoc` to upgrade
- `pip uninstall quipucamayoc` to remove

Note that `quipucamayoc` has been tested against Python 3.10 and newer versions, but should also work with Python 3.9.

### Git Install

After cloning the repo to your computer and navigating to the quipucamayoc folder, run:

- `python setup.py install` to install the package locally
- `python setup.py develop` to install locally with a symlink so changes are automatically updated (recommended for developers)

## Why "quipucamayoc"?

The _quipucamayocs_ were the Inca empire officials in charge of desciphering (amonst other things) accounting information stored in quipus. Our goal for this package is to act as a sort of quipucamayoc, helping researchers in desciphering and extracting historical information, particularly balance sheets and numerical records.
