        PyEarth is a lightweight Python package to support various Earth science tasks.
        It is designed to be a general-purpose library as it is inspired by the popular IDL Coyote library (http://www.idlcoyote.com/).
        
        Some of the code structure is inspired by the ArcGIS toolbox.
        
        # Content
        PyEarth mainly provides many general purpose funcations to support other libaries.
        These functions are classified into several categories:
        1. GIS: This component provides major spatial dataset operations.
        2. Toolbox: This component provides many fuctions for data, date, math, etc.
        3. Visual: This component provides plotting function for time series, scatter, etc.
        4. System: This component provides system wide operations.
        
        You can either call these functions through this package, or you can modify them for your own applications.
