Description: # uro
        Using a URL list for security testing can be painful as there are a lot of URLs that have uninteresting/duplicate content; `uro` aims to solve that.
        
        It doesn't make any http requests to the URLs and removes:
        - human written content e.g. blog posts
        - urls with same path but parameter value difference
        - incremental urls e.g. `/cat/1/` and `/cat/2/`
        - image, js, css and other static files
        
        #### Usage
        First, install uro with pip:
        ```
        pip3 install uro
        ```
        Now, there's just one way to use it, no args, no bullshit.
        ```
        cat urls.txt | uro
        ```
