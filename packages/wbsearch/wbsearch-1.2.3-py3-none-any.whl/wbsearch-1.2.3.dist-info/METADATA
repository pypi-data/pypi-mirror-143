# WbSearch

Search anything on your main browser directly from terminal (both words and links).

Installation:

    $ pip install wbsearch

Usage:

    $ wbsearch argument

Replace argument with your own research. \
In case you want to search multiple words, you may need to use "\" before each space, \
or use double quotes around, depending on your operating system.

    $ wbsearch --set keyword link
    
    $ wbsearch -s keyword link

Replace keyword with your own keyword, and link with your own link. \
This method allows to locally set constant keywords.
For example, if I type:
    
    $ wbsearch -s youtube https://www.youtube.com/ 

Everytime I write in terminal "wbsearch youtube", wbsearch will open the \
saved link referring to "youtube" keyword.
