# Webcash

Webcash is an experimental new electronic cash ("e-cash") that enables decentralized and instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Users send webcash to one another directly on a decentralized peer-to-peer basis by copying-and-pasting their webcash to their recipient. The central server helps webcash wallets detect double-spending and ensure the integrity of the monetary supply according to the supply schedule.
