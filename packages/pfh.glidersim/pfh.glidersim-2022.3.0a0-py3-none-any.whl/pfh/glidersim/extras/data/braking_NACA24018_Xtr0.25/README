These are from a crude utility that curved the trailing edge using two circles
along the top edge (which maintained the length of the upper surface), and
a quadratic Bezier along the lower surface (no attempt was made to maintain the
lower surface length). The polars were generated with XFLR5, then resampled
onto grids. During resampling, the `Cl` and `Cl_alpha` were smoothed using
a 10th order polynomial to improve convergence in Phillips' method.

The values in `nonuniform_grid.csv` are over a non-uniform but regular grid
over the values, making it suitable for use with `RegularGridInterpolator`.

The values in `uniform_grid.csv` were resampled to produce a grid with uniform
spacing in each dimension. The uniform resampling has a lot of redundancy, but
the regularity makes it suitable for use with `fast_interp`.
