cbcbeat is a collection of Python-based solvers for cardiac
electrophysiology models. cbcbeat offers basic and optimized solvers
for the bidomain and monodomain equations coupled with cardiac cell
models. cbcbeat is based on the FEniCS Project and dolfin-adjoint.

For more information visit http://cbcbeat.readthedocs.org

Installation:
=============

See separate file ./INSTALL for how to install the cbcbeat module and
a list of dependencies.

Documentation:
==============

The cbcbeat documention is availble on readthedocs, see:

    http://cbcbeat.readthedocs.org

For manually updating the API and demo documentation, run:

    cd doc
    make html

assuming that cbcbeat and the optional dependency Sphinx
(sphinx-doc.org) is installed.

Automated Testing:
==================

cbcbeat uses Bitbucket Pipelines for automated and continuous testing:
