    Thin helper to remove a sharp edge from the urllib urljoin. The Base url
    must have a trailing / to preserve the last element of the path:

class process:
    """Basic process handle

    This class implements the basics for a oneseismic process, initialised from
    a promise. It is intended as a tool library developers for managing URL
    generation and encoding the conventions and paths in oneseismic, but
    without the pinning the choice (or timing) of transport.

    Any reasonable action or query you would do against a process, either
    running, completed, or defunct, should in some respect be available through
    here. Library developers should use this and avoid hard-coding assumptions
    about endpoint layout.

    This class is "actionless" in the sense that it does not actually *perform*
    any network operations, it just provides the parameters required to do so.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str
        The query, e.g. sliceByIndex
    promise: dict
        The promise, parsed from json to dict

        ----------

            the relative path

        -------

        Notes
        -----
        Code should not assume much about the content of the path, as the
        endpoint can be changed without notice. Accessing through stream()
        should always give a good URL.

    the response. This function assumes procs_from_promises (or similar) has
