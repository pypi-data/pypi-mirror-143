"""Azure tools for oneseismic

This module makes a lot of assumptions on your behalf, but is entirely
optional, i.e. oneseismic does not depend on details implemented here. The
module does not offer many configuration options in order to keep the interface
small and simple, and to avoid simply being an obfuscation layer over the azure
libraries. If you need more flexibility or different parameters then you must
write bespoke azure integration.

    going right away.
