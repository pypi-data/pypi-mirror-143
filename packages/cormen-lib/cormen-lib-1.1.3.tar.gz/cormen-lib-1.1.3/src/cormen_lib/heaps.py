"""This module holds classes and functions related to heaps and priority queues.

This module contains `PriorityQueue`, an implementation of a priority queue, and `PriorityQueueUnderflowError`, an error
raised by `PriorityQueue`. This module also contains the function `build_min_heap` which modifies the elements of an
`cormen_lib.arrays.Array` so that they construct a min heap.

Examples:
    Initializing, adding, and removing elements from a `PriorityQueue`:

        q = PriorityQueue()
        q.insert('a', 2)
        q.insert('b', 1)
        q.extract_min()

    The following code will raise a `PriorityQueueUnderflowError` because the second extract min is done on an empty
    `PriorityQueue`:

        q.extract_min()
        q.extract_min()
