"""This module holds classes related to graphs.

This module contains the `Vertex`, `VertexAttributeError`, `Graph`, and `GraphVertexError` classes. `Vertex` represents
a graph vertex. `VertexAttributeError` is an error raised by `Vertex`. `Graph` represents a directed graph.
`GraphVertexError` is an error raised by `Graph`.

Examples:
    Initializing a `Graph` as well as adding colored vertices and edges:

        g = Graph()
        a = Vertex('a', color='red')
        b = Vertex('b', color='blue')
        g.add_vertex(a)
        g.add_vertex(b)
        g.add_edge(a, b)

    The following code will raise a `VertexAttributeError` because `'colour'` is not an attribute of the `Vertex` `a`:

        x = a['colour']

class Vertex:

    A `Vertex` has a name and a collection of customizable attributes. The name should be used to identify it in a
    `Graph`. `Vertex` objects are compared with `==` and via hash code based on their name. The attributes you can use
    in graph algorithms. For example, you could set colors or time steps as in DFS. One should assume all operations
    that can be performed on a `Vertex` are done in `O(1)` time.

    Examples:
        To initialize a `Vertex` with a name:

            v = Vertex('a')

        To initialize a `Vertex` with some starting attributes, use keyword arguments following the name:

            v = Vertex('a', color='red', time=1)

        To add additional attributes to an existing `Vertex` using `[]` with `=`:

            v['seen'] = False

        To update or view existing attributes, use the same idea:

            x = v['color']
            v['time'] = 3

        If you try to get the value of an attribute that does not exist, a `VertexAttributeError` will be raised (e.g.
        calling `print(v['colour'])`. If you try to add a new attribute to an existing `Vertex` where the attribute's
        type is not `str`, a `TypeError` will be raised (e.g. calling `v[1] = 'blue'`).
