```

Tools needed to build and publish to PyPi Linux/MacOS:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
```


Build package:

```
python -m build
```

Upload package to pypi:

Before uploading, delete outdated build artifacts in the `dist` folder, such that only the latest build files are uploaded.

```
