 Basic  SLIP-39 Mnemonic creation                 
 Extra  Enhanced SLIP-39 creation and recover     
 Pro    Conversion of BIP-39 Mnemonics to SLIP-39 


1 Basic
=======

  A basic SLIP-39 Mnemonic creation interface.


2 Extra
=======

  Greater control over the Mnemonic creation process.


2.1 Extra Seed Entropy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Probably most importantly, Extra Entropy can be supplied.  Any data
  supplied (Dice rolls, for example, add about 2.5 bits of entropy per
  roll) is hashed with a standard SHA-512 hash function, which can be
  independently confirmed.

  Finally, you can visually confirm that the Entropy is correctly
  applied via XOR to the Seed Data Source, to produce the Master Secret
  Seed.

  At no point do you need to "Trust" that the SLIP-39 program is
  producing a Master Secret Seed from known data!


2.2 SLIP-39
~~~~~~~~~~~

  Supports input of existing SLIP-39 mnemonics to recover the original
  Seed.


3 Pro
=====

  Advanced SLIP-39 creation and recovery, and conversion of BIP-39
  Mnemonics to SLIP-39.

  Requires licensing.


3.1 BIP-39
~~~~~~~~~~

  Conversion of existing, fragile BIP-39 12- or 24-word Mnemonic phrases
  into SLIP-39 is supported.

  Enter the BIP-39 recover phrase, to recover the 512-bit Seed and
  generate SLIP-39 59-word Mnemonics which will recover the same Master
  Secret Seed as the original 12- or 24-word BIP-39 Mnemonic.


3.1.1 Not Trezor Compatible
---------------------------

  Unfortunately, the Trezor only implements 128-bit (20 word) and
  256-bit (33-word) Mnemonics, so the BIP-39 Seed converted to SLIP-39
  cannot be entered directly into a Trezor.

  However, the `SLIP-39' App can generate Paper Wallets, allowing import
  of individual Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. wallets derived from the Seed
  into any software wallet for recovery of the funds.
