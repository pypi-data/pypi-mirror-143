1 Random
========

  A high-quality 128-bit random value is adequate.

  2^128 is aproximately 10^38.  There are about 10^57 atoms in our solar
  system, and about 10^19 atoms in a particle of dust.

  Therefore, the odds of 2 people picking the *specific* identical
  high-quality random 128-bit Seed (1 in 10^38), is about the same as 2
  people randomly selecting the same particle of *dust* out of the mass
  of our entire solar system!

  So, probably fine for most practical levels of account security...


1.1 The Birthday Paradox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  However, due to the [Birthday Attack], the probability of two parties
  out of /a large number creating Seeds/ having a Seed *collision*
  (accidentally selecting the same Seed value) is somewhat greater.

  If every human created a few Seeds (about 10^13), the probability of
  an /accidental/ collision falls to about 1 in 10^12 -- about 1 in a
  billion.

  So, if a 1 in a billion chance of someone eventually stumbling upon
  your wallet is too great a risk, chose a 256-bit random Seed where
  this Birthday Paradox probability falls to 1 in 10^32 -- approximately
  the chance of 2 people on earth picking the same virus-sized particle
  in our solar system.

2 SLIP-39
=========

  Here's where you can restore a lost Seed using recovered SLIP-39
  Mnemonics.

  You don't have to worry about sorting the Mnemonics into Groups or
  anything; we'll be able to recover the Seed, if you provide us with a
  sufficient threshold of SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, from the required
  threshold number of separate Groups.


2.1 Fixing Partially Lost Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you know you've lost access to some cards, and want to repair your
  SLIP-39 backup, you can recover the Seed from the current SLIP-39
  Mnemonic cards, here -- and generate a *new* set of SLIP-39 Mnemonic
  cards for the *same* Seed.

  Distribute the cards as you wish, again; either the old (partially
  degraded) SLIP-39 Groups, *or* the new SLIP-39 Groups can be used to
  recover your Seed.  Obviously, cards from the old and new SLIP-39
  Mnemonics can't be "mixed" together to recover the Seed.


3 BIP-39
========

  Convert an existing BIP-39 12- or 24-word Mnemonic into a 512-bit
  Seed.

  This allows you to "back up" your BIP-39 Mnemonic to a set of 59-word
  SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards.  You can then securely destroy your BIP-39
  Mnemonic cards (or, keep one copy somewhere *extremely* secure, and
  use the SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards as your distributed backup in case of
  its loss).

  However, since 59-word SLIP-39 Mnemonics are not (yet) directly
  supported by any hardware wallet (not even the Trezor Model T), you
  would have to produce individual Paper Wallets for each cryptocurrency
  wallet you want to recover funds from.

  This is not too onerous, if the SLIP-39 recovery is only needed in
  case of account loss, or for accessing a small number of "cold" crypto
  wallets.  If you plan on generating hundreds or thousands of crypto
  wallets from your Seed, and you need to use a hardware wallet to
  access them, then converting your BIP-39 Mnemonic to SLIP-39 may not
  be ideal.

  For most applications, however -- *we recommend converting BIP-39
  Mnemonics to SLIP-39, and distributing these SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards
  instead of trying to securely and reliably back up your BIP-39
  Mnemonic* (because, basically, that's impossible to do both reliably
  and securely).
