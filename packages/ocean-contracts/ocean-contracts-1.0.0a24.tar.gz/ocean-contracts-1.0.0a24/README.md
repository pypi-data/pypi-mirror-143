<!-- With ocean v4, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data.
  Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md)
  datatoken for each dataset / data service.
- **Mint** datatokens for the service
- **Sell** datatokens via an OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto price discovery), or for a fixed price
- **Stake** OCEAN on datatoken pools
- **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
- **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions**
  using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/web3-eth-contract.html) etc. -->

ocean v4 is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in alpha state and you can expect running into problems. If you run into them, please open up a [new issue](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).

## 📚 Prerequisites

- node.js ([Install from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
<!-- - A Unix based operating system (Mac or Linux) -->

<!-- ### Note

Any function that uses `getPastEvents()` will only work on Eth (see: <https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/issues/741>). This includes:

- searchPoolforDT()
- getPoolsbyCreator()
- getPoolSharesByAddress()
- getAllPoolLogs()
- getPreviousValidOrders()
- searchforDT()
- getExchangesbyCreator()
- getExchangeSwaps()
- getAllExchangesSwaps() -->

<!-- ## 🏗 Installation

```bash
npm install @oceanprotocol/lib
``` -->

## 🏄 Quickstart



### Features

- NFT-ize base IP: a new way of representing baseIP, all newly ERC20 DTs are linked to the NFT contract

- Roles Administration: there are now multiple roles for a more flexible administation both at NFT and ERC20 levels.

- Safer Staking - Better IDOs: An automated DT staking and vesting contract which helps with initial DT distribution and price stability.

  It also provides a customizable vesting schedule for the publisher.

- Help Ocean community: if Ocean is not the basetoken, Ocean Community will receive 0.1% swap fee on pools or fixed price exchange 

- Flexible key-value store in the NFT contract : NFT contract can be used to store custom key-value pairs

- Metadata is also stored in the NFT contract store (even if it still supports Metadata.sol)

- Marketplace fees flexibility: now any marketplace runner can set more customized fees structure.

- Multiple NFT template support: the Factory can deploy different types of NFT templates. 

- Multiple ERC20 template support: the Factory can deploy different types of ERC20 templates

## 🦑 Development


```bash
npm install
npx hardhat node
```

<!-- ## ✨ Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
``` -->

## 👩‍🔬 Testing


You can execute all tests with:

```bash
# run hardhat node each time you want to test with the current settings
npx hardhat node

npm run test:full
# same thing, but with coverage reporting
npm run test:full:cover
```

<!-- Test suite for unit & integration tests is setup with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as test runner, and [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) for coverage reporting. A combined coverage report is sent to CodeClimate via the `coverage` GitHub Actions job.

Running all tests requires running Ocean Protocol components beforehand with [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge), which also runs a `ganache-cli` instance:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge
cd barge

./start_ocean.sh --with-provider2 --no-dashboard
```

You can then proceed to run in another terminal.

Let ocean.js know where to pickup the smart contract addresses, which has been written out by Barge in this location:

```
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
```

Build metadata:

```
npm run build:metadata
```

Executing linting, type checking, unit, and integration tests with coverage reporting all in one go:

```bash
npm test
``` -->

### Unit Tests

You can execute unit tests with:

```bash
# run hardhat node each time you want to test with the current settings
npx hardhat node

npm run test:unit

```

### Flow Tests

You can execute flow tests with:

```bash
# run hardhat node each time you want to test with the current settings
npx hardhat node

npm run test:flow

```

<!-- ## 🛳 Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
``` -->

<!-- ## ⬆️ Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's machine with release scripts.

### Production

From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger a GitHub Action workflow to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases) -->
