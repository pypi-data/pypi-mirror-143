## Contributing

## Publishing

To publish the InOrbit CLI package to the testing package index you'll need a token from [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org). Otherwise you'll need a token from [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org) (The official python packages index)
To get the token, register a new account and ask for an invite to the project.  
Once you accept the invite, go to your profile and generate a new token for the "InOrbit CLI".  
After that, to publish the package, first set the environment variable 'TWINE_PASSWORD' doing:  

```bash
export TWINE_PASSWORD="your-token-from-pypi.org"
./publish.sh -p
```

NOTE: passing -p to the script means "production", the package will be published in the official package index, if you want to publish it in the test package index just run:

```bash
export TWINE_PASSWORD="your-token-from-test.pypi.org"
./publish.sh -t
```
