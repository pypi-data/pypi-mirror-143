===============

#. Make sure all tests pass.
#. Create and checkout a release branch.
#. Bump version in ``/icclim/__init__.py`` and ``setup.py``.
#. Update release notes in ``doc/source/references/release_notes.rst``.
#. Merge release branch to master with a PR.
#. Clean dist directory content.
#. Create wheel file on master.

    .. code-block:: sh

        python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

#. Create source archive.

    .. code-block:: sh

        python3 -m setup.py sdist

#. Try to upload on testpypi first.

    .. code-block:: sh

        python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

#. Try to install testpypi version on a clean virtual environment.

    .. code-block:: sh

        python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ icclim

.. note::

    It may fail due to missing dependencies in test.pypi.
    In that case, create the environment from icclim environment.yml file to
    pull all needed dependencies from conda.

#. Upload to pypi for real.

    .. code-block:: sh

        python3 -m twine upload dist/*
