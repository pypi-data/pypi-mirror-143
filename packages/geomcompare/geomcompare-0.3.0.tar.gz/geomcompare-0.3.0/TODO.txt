- get_geometries
- update effect of AOI param in true_positives, false_positives and
  missing geometries and SQL queries: reference geoms do not always
  need to both intersect with input geoms and AOI. Spatial queries are
  more optimized if checking only against input geoms. Still, AOI
  param must remain available as one could want to restrict these
  analyses to a smaller area than the one covered by input geoms
  and/or reference geoms. Maybe filtering input geoms before running
  the is good if the AOI is smaller than the area covered by the input
  geoms.
- remove_geometries
- Add documentation/tests
- Documentation on Readthedocs
- Upgrade API of PostGISGeomRefDB and RtreeGeomRefDB classes so that
  they match that of the SQLiteGeomRefDB class.
- Possibility to run geomcompare scripts?
- 3D
