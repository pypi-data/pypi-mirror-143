What is it?
===========
DHTMLParser3 is a lightweight HTML/XML parser created for one purpose - quick and easy picking selected tags from DOM.

It can be very useful when you are in need to write own "guerilla" API for some webpage, or a scrapper.

It is written in pure python with no dependencies, and it can handle pretty badly broken HTML.

Documentation
=============
