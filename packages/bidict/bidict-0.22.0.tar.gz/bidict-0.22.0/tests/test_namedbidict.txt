Test script for bidict.namedbidict:

    >>> from bidict import namedbidict
    >>> ElBySym = namedbidict('ElBySym', 'sym', 'el')
    >>> el_by_sym = ElBySym(H='hydrogen')
    >>> el_by_sym['H']
    'hydrogen'
    >>> el_by_sym.inverse['hydrogen']
    'H'
    >>> el_by_sym.keyname
    'sym'
    >>> el_by_sym.valname
    'el'
    >>> el_by_sym.el_for['H']
    'hydrogen'
    >>> el_by_sym.sym_for['hydrogen']
    'H'
    >>> el_by_sym.inverse.el_for['H']
    'hydrogen'
    >>> el_by_sym.inverse.sym_for['hydrogen']
    'H'
    >>> el_by_sym['He'] = 'helium'
    >>> el_by_sym
    ElBySym({'H': 'hydrogen', 'He': 'helium'})
    >>> el_by_sym.inverse
    ElBySymInv({'hydrogen': 'H', 'helium': 'He'})
