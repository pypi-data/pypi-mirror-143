        A CLI tool to automate repetitive tasks during management of documents and
        media files
        
        ## Included programs
        
        * `imgresize` Resize images to smaller resolutions applying same effect as
          'cover' css, useful for wallpapers and background images management
        * `iterate` Iterates files in a path and opens it in default application,
           useful for review pictures or multiple docs in a folder
        * `iteratefrom` Iterates each line of given file as a path and will open
           it in default system program.
        * `moviefixname` Assists in the process of renaming movie files into a
           format like `<Title> (Year) - <Resolution> - <Audio Lang> <Extra>.<ext>`.
           Use this for your plex library 😉
