## Overview

 **ngsildclient** is a Python library that helps building NGSI-LD entities and allows to interact with a NGSI-LD Context Broker.

 The library primary purpose is to **ease and speed up the development of a NGSI Agent** and is also **useful for Data Modeling in the design stage**.

## Key Features

### Build NGSI-LD entities

The task of building a large NGSI-LD compliant entity is tedious, error-prone and results in a significant amount of code. 

**ngsildclient** provides primitives to build and manipulate NGSI-LD compliant entities without effort, in respect with the [ETSI specifications](https://www.etsi.org/committee/cim).

### Implement the NGSI-LD API

**ngsildclient** provides a NGSI-LD API Client implementation.

Acting as a Context Producer/Consumer **ngsildclient** is able to send/receive NGSI-LD entities to/from the Context Broker for creation and other operations.

The library wraps a large subset of the API endpoints and supports batch operations, queries, subscriptions.

## Where to get it

The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at :
https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/python-ngsild-client

package index](https://pypi.org/project/ngsildclient).

```sh
pip install ngsildclient
```

## Installation

**ngsildclient** requires Python 3.9+.

One should use a virtual environment. For example with pyenv.

```sh
mkdir myagent && cd myagent
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.2 myagent
pyenv local myagent
pip install ngsildclient
```
