{"scenarioVersion":0,"title":"The Layover","description":"When a traveler's flight is cancelled, he's forced to share a hotel room for the night with a fellow passenger.","prompt":"\"You'll be in room number 104, with miss Novikov.\" the receptionist said, sliding a key across the desk to me.\n\"I'm sorry, 'with'...?\" I asked, exasperated. \"What do you mean? I have to share the room?\"\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" the receptionist offered, flashing me an apologetic smile. \"The airline has booked passengers flying alone two to a room. I can offer you a single room, but the airline won't cover-\"\n\"No, it'll have to do.\" I cut her off irritably, snatching the key from the desk with a sigh. After all, it was that, or pay for a room myself.\nI'd been scheduled to fly home that morning, but my flight had been delayed—first for an hour, then two, then until the evening. Finally, they'd cancelled it until the following day and offered to compensate us with hotel rooms for the night. After an entire day wasted waiting in an uncomfortable terminal, the last thing I'd wanted to hear was that the airline had skimped on the accommodation. Gathering my luggage, and assuring myself I was never flying with this airline again, I made my way to my room to simply turn in for the night.\nAs I stood outside room 104, fumbling with the key, my thoughts were still occupied with my irritation at the airline—so much so, in fact, that until the door swung open, it completely slipped my mind that I was sharing the room with another passenger. Had I remembered, I'd have thought to knock first, or at least announce myself. Instead, I found myself gaping wide-eyed at my roommate—half in shock at the realization I'd just walked in on her unannounced, and half in awe of the sight that greeted me.\nShe stood facing away from me, unabashedly naked, looking like something straight from the airbrushed pages of a magazine. She was a tall woman, easily six foot, with a sleek, athletic build and long, eye-catching legs. Her body was perfect: she had a soft, curvy feminine form, with just enough tone to hint at the muscle hidden beneath her flawless skin. Her body glistened with water: droplets made their way slowly down the contours of her bare back, catching my eye and leading it lower, to the pert hips and firm, heart-shaped buttocks that capped those gorgeous legs. When I tore my face from her shapely rear, I turned it upon a profile every bit as stunning as her body. She had strong features, her elegant face framed by a handsome jawline. Her platinum-blonde hair was cut short, in a boyish pixie cut that perfectly accentuated her striking appearance. She regarded me with dark, smokey eyes, her plush lips pursed quizzically.\nFor a moment, I could only stare, utterly transfixed by what I saw. In turn, she stared over her shoulder at me, equally surprised, though her expression was one of intrigue rather than shock or fear. Several long seconds passed, neither of us moving, before I managed to find my tongue and regain control of my faculties.\n\"S-so sorry!\" I stammered, turning my head and averting my gaze, suddenly aware of how long I'd been staring at her. \"I forgot I was sharing this room! I didn't mean to-\"\n\"It's fine.\" she cut in, in a thick Eastern European accent, tinged with a hint of amusement. \"Is not every day you share hotel room with a stranger.\"\nHer voice was low and husky—a sultry baritone, as exotic as it was seductive. In her voice, as in her body, there was a compelling contradiction to this woman: a paradoxical beauty despite her masculine qualities. Her towering height, her athletic build, her strong jaw, even her deep voice; all were traditionally powerful, manly traits, yet somehow they seemed feminine on her.\nI heard damp footfalls on the carpet, followed by the sound of a door sliding shut, and when I looked up, she was gone. Noises echoed from the closed door of the en suite. My cheeks burned with embarrassment as I busied myself putting my luggage away. She had clearly already chosen her pick of the twin beds, having left her suitcase open on it, so I took the other. A few minutes later, the en suite door slid open and the woman emerged, clad in a black silken nightdress that cut off just below her hips. The sheer material clung to her curves as she moved, leaving little to the imagination.\n\"Look, about before-\" I began, but once again she cut me off.\n\"Viktoria,\" she announced, a faint smile playing across her gorgeous features. \"And you are?\"\n\"Oh, I'm ${name}.\" I said, trying not to let my gaze wander.\n\"Is a pleasure to meet you, ${name}.\" Viktoria offered, breaking into a smile as she added; \"Though next time, you might consider knocking.\"\n\"Right, sorry about that.\" I apologized, sitting down on the edge of my bed. Viktoria followed suit, flopping down onto her own. She let out a sigh and drew her knees up to her chest, the hem of her nightdress slipping from her thigh to expose a tantalizing glimpse of her hip.","tags":["slice of life","smut","embarrassment","nudity","exhibitionist","strangers","male on female","power bottom","first person","voyer"],"context":[{"text":"[I was ${name}, a traveler, and my flight had been delayed until tomorrow morning.
