# Python Experiment Suite

_PyExperimentSuite_ is an open source software tool written in Python, that supports scientists, engineers and others to conduct automated software experiments on a large scale with numerous different parameters.

It reads parameters (or ranges of parameters) from a configuration file, runs the experiments using multiple cores if desired and logs the results in files. Parameter combinations can be evaluated as a grid (each combination of parameters) or in a list (try several defined parameter combinations in row). _PyExperimentSuite_ also supports continuing any experiments where left off when the execution was interrupted (e.g. power failure, process was killed, etc.). The experiment results can be obtained in different ways by a built-in Python interface.
