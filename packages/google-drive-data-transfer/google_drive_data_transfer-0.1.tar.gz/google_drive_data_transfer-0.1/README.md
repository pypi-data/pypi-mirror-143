## Quickstart

1. Go to the [APIs Console](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects)
   and make your own project.
2. Search for 'Google Drive API', select the entry, and click 'Enable'.
3. Select 'Credentials' from the left menu, click 'Create Credentials', select
   'OAuth client ID'.
4. Now, the product name and consent screen need to be set -> click
   'Configure consent screen' and follow the instructions. Once finished:
5. Select 'Application type' to be Web application.
6. Enter an appropriate name.
7. Input http://localhost:8080/ for 'Authorized redirect URIs'.
8. Click 'Create'.
9. Click 'Download JSON' on the right side of Client ID to download
   `client_secret_<really long ID>.json`.
10. The downloaded file has all authentication information of your application.
    Rename the file to `client_secrets.json` and place it in your working directory.
    
The `auth_dir` attribute you need to provide when instantiating `GoogleDriveData` class
must be the directory which contains the `client_secrets.json`. When you instantiate and
object of the `GoogleDriveData` class for the first time, you will see a web browser
asking you for authentication. Click 'Accept', and you are done with authentication.
This needs to be done only once.

Parts of the Quickstart documentation were taken from the
[PyDrive2 documentation](https://docs.iterative.ai/PyDrive2/quickstart/#authentication).
