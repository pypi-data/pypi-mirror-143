# Radio Gyms

![Radio Gyms](https://github.com/intelek-ai/radio-gyms/blob/master/assets/logo.png)

Radio Gyms is an open-source bundle of AI environments for radio communications. The simulations are composed of Open AI Gym and various theoretical radio propagation models, specifically for AI research in telecommunications. 

## Installation

```commandline
pip install radio_gyms
```

## Examples
### 1. Calling Primitive Ray Tracer for Outdoor Propagation
Radio gyms provides the toolkit for building wireless communication simulations. 
The ray tracer can be called for computing the radio propagation paths in the following example.
```python
import radio_gyms.engines as Tracer

SCENE_FILE_PATH = "./city.obj"
tracer = Tracer(SCENE_FILE_PATH)
# position (x, y, z)
tx_pos = [0, 15, 0]
rx_pos = [-30, 1.5, 45]
# get traced result
result = tracer.trace_outdoor(tx_pos, rx_pos)
# result
# {'direct': False, 
# 'reflections': {'single': [   array([-28.94988531,   4.22886929,  62.39469675]),
#                               array([-70.80339945,   7.04682531,  15.22840999])],
#                  'double': []},
# 'tx_pos': array([ 0, 15,  0]),
# 'rx_pos': array([-30. ,   1.5,  45. ]),
# 'roof_edges': [array([-19.24403786,   8.5621709 ,  28.8660568 ])]}
```
