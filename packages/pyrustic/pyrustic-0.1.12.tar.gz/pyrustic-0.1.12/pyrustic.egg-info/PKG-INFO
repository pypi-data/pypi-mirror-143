# Pyrustic Open Ecosystem
**Pyrustic** is a collection of lightweight [Python](https://www.python.org/) projects that share the **same policy**.

The goal is to build and maintain a reliable, consistent, easy-to-use and relevant Python codebase for novice and experienced developers.

These projects cover various topics: data persistence and exchange, GUI, themes, widgets, multithreading, markup, utilities, project management, et cetera. 

## Projects
Projects can be subdivided into the following subsections: frameworks, libraries, themes, command line tools, and apps.

### Frameworks
|Name | Description                                       |
|---|---------------------------------------------------|
|[Gaspium](https://github.com/pyrustic/gaspium) | Reference framework to build `GASP` apps |

> **Note:** Previously, two frameworks were listed: **TkF** and **Gaspium**. Both allow to make desktop applications. **TkF** is now obsolete since **Gaspium** has become the best at this game.

### Libraries

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Shared](https://github.com/pyrustic/shared) | Data exchange and persistence |
| [Hackernote](https://github.com/pyrustic/backstage) | Reference library to parse and render hackernotes |
| [Subrun](https://github.com/pyrustic/subrun) | Intuitive API to safely start and communicate with processes in Python |
| [TkStyle](https://github.com/pyrustic/tkstyle) | Library to create styles and themes for Python apps |
| [Litemark](https://github.com/pyrustic/litemark) | Lightweight Markdown dialect for Python apps |
| [Megawidget](https://github.com/pyrustic/megawidget) | Collection of megawidgets to build graphical user interfaces for Python apps |
| [Viewable](https://github.com/pyrustic/viewable) | Python library to implement a GUI view with lifecycle |
| [Threadom](https://github.com/pyrustic/threadom) | Tkinter-compatible multithreading |
| [Suggestion](https://github.com/pyrustic/suggestion) | Democratizing auto-complete(suggest) for Python desktop applications |
| [Kurl](https://github.com/pyrustic/kurl) | Konnection URL: HTTP requests in Python with an implementation of conditional request and a responses caching system |
| [Probed](https://github.com/pyrustic/probed) | Probed collections for Python |

> **Note:** The framework **Gaspium** comes with batteries included. These lightweight libraries listed above are the batteries. 



### Themes
|Name | Description|
|---|---|
|[Cyberpunk-Theme](https://github.com/pyrustic/cyberpunk-theme) | A modern `dark theme` for Python apps|
|[Winter-Theme](https://github.com/pyrustic/winter-theme) | A modern `light theme` for Python apps|

> **Note:** These command line tools are used to setup and manage all the projects listed on this page.
>
> **Fun fact:** The tool **backstage** is used to release a new version of **backstage**


### Apps
|Name | Description|

> **Note:** The apps listed above may not work as the underlying framework and libraries are under heavy development. 
>
> **These applications will be gradually updated.**
